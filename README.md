# To-Do List Web Application

This is a simple To-Do List web application built using **Vue 3**, **Vue Router**, and **Vuex**. The application allows users to manage their tasks, with data being stored locally in the browser's `localStorage`. No database is used for this project.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Create new tasks with a title and description.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify the title or description of existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Task Status**: Organize tasks into "Pending", "Finished", and "Trashed" categories.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are saved locally in the browser using `localStorage`, so your tasks persist even after refreshing the page.

## Tech Stack

- **Vue 3**: JavaScript framework for building the UI and managing state.
- **Vue Router**: Handling routing for navigating between different pages or views in the application.
- **Vuex**: State management for global state like tasks, which are shared across components.
- **localStorage**: Persist data in the user's browser without needing a backend.
